# The Beginner’s Guide to CfgMgmtCamp

CfgMgmtCamp is one of the longest running OSS focused DevOps conferences in the
world. Many of the luminaries in our field cut their DevOps teeth in Ghent and
it’s still going strong. You’ll learn so much here and make so many new exciting
friends and spark so many ideas.

But it’s community volunteer organized, free, and low budget so you may not find
all the amenities you’re expecting from the big-budget conferences. There’s no
concierge desk, no AI driven venue map app on your phone, not even any Ice Cube
concerts.

Instead, you’ll find an information and idea rich environment and lots of
opportunity to engage. This guide is intended to help lower some of the
logistical friction, so that you can focus on learning.


1. **Getting there**

    The easiest way to get to Ghent is to fly to Brussels and take the train. Head
    down to baggage claim and you’ll find vending machines where you can purchase
    your train ticket to the **Gent-Sint-Pieters** station. From there, see #3 for
    local transportation.

    Do not assume that you can stay in Brussels and commute to Ghent. You’ll spend a
    lot of time on the train and you’ll miss all the social events.

    1. **Coming from Fosdem**

        If you’re coming from Fosdem and are traveling light, then you may be interested
        in carpooling instead of the train. Please reach out to Kris Buytaert for more
        information and coordination.

1. **Where to stay**

    Don’t look for a place by the conference. Ghent city center is where most
    extracurricular activity will occur and it’s not far. Many people stay at either
    the [Novotel](https://all.accor.com/ssr/app/accor/rates/0840/index.en.shtml) or
    the [NH](https://www.nh-hotels.com/en/hotel/nh-collection-gent), but there are
    plenty of other options nearby.

1. **Local transportation on the tram or bus**

    [Public transit in Ghent](https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/getting-around/public-transport-ghent)
    is quite navigable. The easiest way to get around is via contactless with your
    phone or card. Just tap on the white terminal each time you enter a bus or tram.
    You’ll be charged (€2.50) only once for an hour.

    You can also buy a pack of 10 tickets at the ***Lijnwinkel*** inside the
    Gent-Sint-Pieters or Korenmarkt stations or at a machine at many tram or bus
    stops.

    If you’re planning to stay extra and sightsee, you might consider a
    [CityCard Ghent](https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/citycard-gent).
    One reasonable price to get unlimited local transportation and entrance to
    attractions, monuments, museums, and other sights. The local city bus is fairly
    extensive and will take you even to other nearby cities, like Bruges.

1. **The venue: *HoGhent SchoonMeersen***

    1. **Finding your way around.**

        Take the tram in from city center to the HoGhent SchoonMeersen campus. Don’t
        expect to see a lot of signage directing you though. This is a volunteer run
        conference without big marketing budgets. There won’t be a lot of students
        around at this time, so if you see groups of people carrying laptops, they’re
        probably a good bet to follow. This [Google maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/STnKypnvg1btZP947)
        will take you directly to the front door of the conference lobby, where
        you’ll see vendor tables, coffee, pastries, etc.

        The conference is primarily in the *B* building. The main bathrooms are on the
        ground floor, through the large doors to the left. Other bathrooms will
        alternate genders on each of the floors. Several conference rooms are also on
        the ground floor. Many are on upper floors, you’ll find the elevator and stairs
        to the right. The rooms are coded as `<Building>.<Floor>.<Room>`. In
        other words, *B.3.039* is building *B*, third floor, room *39*.

    1. **Paying attention to the schedule and following updates**

        Wifi access will be shared during the conference introduction in the *D auditorium*.
        You’ll want this for the schedule and other such, but please don’t abuse it.

        [Open the schedule](https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.org/2025/schedule/) on your phone
        and/or laptop. Plan ahead which talks, or tracks, or speakers you’re excited to
        see and figure out where the rooms are. Then pay attention around you. If
        schedule changes are required, such as running 15 minutes behind or the like,
        they won’t be announced over a loudspeaker. Instead, you’ll overhear it or see
        crowds of people start moving. Don’t hesitate to ask someone what’s going on.
        We’re all helping each other out.

    1. **The common area and hallway track**

        The lobby is where vendors will have their tables set up. There will be coffee,
        fruits, pastries, and such. And there will be a lot of people excited to talk to
        each other. This is where most of the hallway track happens. When you’re done
        with a talk and you don’t have anything in particular to do, you should come
        here. If you are in the lobby and it seems particularly empty, then there’s
        probably a talk happening. If you didn’t expect that, ask someone. There may
        have been a schedule change that didn’t get published.

    1. **Swag pickup**

        Walter will have to do this section 😀

    1. **Front and back entrances to the main stage**

        The keynotes are in the *D auditorium*, which is directly across the courtyard
        from the lobby. You can either enter the ground floor door which takes you in by
        the front stage, or you can go up the stairs and enter from the back. If you’re
        late to a talk, please enter from the back.

    1. **Overflow rooms**

        *B.Con* is the ground floor auditorium across from the bathrooms. This room has
        talks but is also the overflow room for streamed keynotes when *D.Aud* is full.

    1. **How lunch and other food works**

        Lunch is in the cafeteria in the D building just past the auditorium down the
        large open-air walkway between the buildings. You’ll likely see a long line
        gathering, but it moves fairly quickly. Lunch is cafeteria style; pick what you
        want and pay at the register.

        Breakfast pastries are available in the conference lobby each morning. It’s not
        much, so if you’re big on breakfast then you probably want to eat before you
        head in.

        Sometimes if we’re lucky a magic waffle truck shows up on the second day with
        delicious free Belgian waffles. Keep an eye out near the sponsor booths and
        listen to the chatter!

    1. **Lost and found or emergencies**

        If you lose or find something or have other emergencies, please go to the
        counter in the lobby.

    1. **Getting help from a coordinator**

        There are quite a few coordinators and they’re recognizable enough that you can
        just start asking attendees if they’ve seen various people. For conference
        logistics and scheduling, ask for ***Toshaan*** or ***Kris***. For venue and room questions
        ask for ***Bert***. Otherwise just ask if anyone has seen a coordinator.

1. **After the talks**

    1. **The official social event**

        There is a social event Monday night after the conference directly across the
        street at [the Zone](https://www.thezone.be/the-zone-cafe/). Before you leave
        the conference, you should get a wristband. Many of the vendor booths will be
        handing them out but there will also be folks wandering around with them. This
        wristband will buy your drinks.

    1. **Peer networking and nightlife**

        Ghent is a wonderful place with [a rich nightlife](https://visit.gent.be/en/eat-drink).
        Make some friends and have dinner or meet for drinks. Some of the conference favorites include

        * Trollekelder bar
        * Waterhuis bar
        * 't Dreupelkot genever bar next door to the Waterhuis. Just don’t spill the genever!
        * Gruut brewery, especially if you’ve never tried gruut
        * Comic Sans pinball arcade
        * Amadeus rib house. Note that there are two, make sure you know which one you’re meeting at!
        * [Lots and lots more](https://visit.gent.be/en/eat-drink)!

1. **The fringe workshops**

    The third day of the conference is not centrally organized. Instead, different
    groups use the space to run their own workshops or “mini conferences” attached
    to the main venue. For example, there will be a Foreman hack day, Community Day
    events for both Puppet and Ansible, an [mgmtconfig](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt)
    workshop, and many more.

    The same rules about lunch and all apply, but there will be no central organization.
    Instead, follow the schedules of the fringe events you’re attending.

    Please try to register ahead for the fringe events so we can plan for the right
    sized rooms. But don’t let it stop you if you forget or you discover an event
    you really want to attend. We want you to get the most out of this you can.

    If we do have to reorganize rooms, there will be a sign taped to the original
    room telling you where to go.

1. **Social media**

    1. **Who to follow**
        1. [https://fosstodon.org/@cfgmgmtcamp](https://fosstodon.org/@cfgmgmtcamp)
        1. [https://bsky.app/profile/cfgmgmtcamp.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/cfgmgmtcamp.bsky.social)
        1. The hashtag `#cfgmgmtcamp` on your social platform of choice.

    1. **Posting and promoting**

        We love when you promote us and tell the world what amazing fun they’re missing
        out on. Share what you’re learning, inspirations you’re having, the sights
        you’re seeing. Share tips for other conference attendees like “it’s time, the
        waffles are here!” Use the hashtag `#cfgmgmtcamp` and/or `#ghent`.

        If something’s going wrong, or you want to give feedback then it’s probably more
        expedient to find one of the coordinators to speak with!

1. **Afterwards**

    1. **Write down your ideas and build something cool**

        You just absorbed an utter firehose of information. Right now, it’s all bouncing
        around in your head, but if you want to truly learn or take action on something
        you saw then you should write it down before it escapes you. Take notes or
        journal. Make a note of the people you met who you’d like to follow up with.

        If work paid for the trip, it’s especially important to write up some kind of
        trip report even if you weren’t asked to do so. This will help them see the
        value of the trip and document all the actionable results that came from it. And
        then next year, it’s more likely that your trip request will be approved and we
        can see you again!

    1. **Plan ahead to submit a talk for next year**

        And speaking of next year, you probably saw a few talks that you could have
        given. Or maybe something similar. See, the people up there speaking are just
        like you. And you have ideas that you can share too. So write some of them down
        while you’re feeling inspired and make a note in your calendar to submit a talk
        when our CFP comes back around.

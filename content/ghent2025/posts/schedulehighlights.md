If you haven't already, it is really time you start looking at our schedule, because we have a packed couple of days scheduled for the beginning of next month.
As usual we start our Monday and Tuesday mornings with a number of Plenary Sessions , 


https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2025/schedule/


On Monday we have our opening talk by Hazel Weakly, a talk about why Configuration is just as difficult as real Programming 
Then we'll have a look at the current state of  Open Tofu , 18 months after the fork.
Only to conclude the morning track with a reminder that its all about Community.

Before lunch we continue with our Ignites .. 5 minute talks where the speakers have 20 slides that auto forward,
awesome short topics about the communities and the tools we care about.

In the afternoon , next to our main tracks we have multiple community rooms.
This year we have 2 rooms for both Puppet and Ansible,  we have a Tofu room, a Pulp , Foreman and Kube room 
and new is a Nix room.  Don't hesitate to switch rooms and learn from different communities
If the tool specific tracks don't give you enough content, there is always the main tracks 
where we are tackling a variety of  topics , new tools and practices.


On Tuesday we repeat the same format ..  in the morning 
we welcome you for a talk on troubleshooting, to be continued with a talk on how to use IaC to move your 
team from being a Bottleneck to become an Enabler.   Before the ignites we'll wrap up the morning with a talk 
on the Pkl language we introduced you to last year ..

In the afternoon we continue with the main tracks,  and the community tracks, where the Tofu track is going 
to be a broader Cloud track.


We wrap up the conference on Tuesday evening with a Round Table, a recording of the Abnormal Devops Round Table.


Wednesday is the 3rd day of our event and there we will break out in Workshops and Community days.
We have now also updated registration so that you can register for the Wednesday events.

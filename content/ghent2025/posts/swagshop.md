As long-time organizers of Config Management Camp, we are happy to share a new addition to this year's conference: a [**swag store!**](https://shop.cfgmgmtcamp.org/)

For over a decade, Config Management Camp has been a cornerstone event for the open-source community, bringing together passionate practitioners to share knowledge, tools, and ideas — all without charging a ticket price. This year, to make the experience even more memorable and to help keep our beloved conference running strong, we’re introducing **pre-orderable swag!**

## Why a Swag Store?
As you know, this event runs on a shoe-string budget, made possible by the dedication of our volunteers and the generosity of our sponsors. Adding a swag store gives you, our community, the chance to support the conference directly while also walking away with some great quality gear to commemorate the best open-source configuration management event around.

The swag store operates on a **pre-order model**, set up by Walter Heck from [Helixiora](https://www.helixiora.com), one of our co-organizers for the past 10+ years. To keep the store low-budget and easy to manage, it runs through Walter's personal company. This approach allows us to minimize costs but does come with some calculated risks for Walter — risks he’s willing to take for the sake of the conference and our community. Thanks Walter!

## How It Works
- **Pre-Order Now, Pick Up at the Conference:**
  Place your order online before Dec 20th and collect your items during Config Management Camp 2025.

- **Printing & Pricing:**
  The prices you pay cover the costs of printing, and any extra proceeds directly support the conference. The more we sell of an item, the cheaper it gets to produce, which helps us even more!

- **Refunds or Donations:**
  Each product has a minimum order quantity needed to make printing possible. If an item doesn’t reach its minimum, you’ll have the option to either receive a refund or donate the amount to help the conference. If you order and pay, but don't come collect the item during the conference, you will not receive a refund.

## Why You Should Order
Not only does your purchase support the sustainability of Config Management Camp, but it also gives you a unique and lasting reminder of your time here. Plus, every time you wear that hoodie or use that water bottle, you'll be sharing a piece of the open-source spirit that makes our community so special.

## Questions?
If you have any questions about the swag store or how it works, feel free to email Walter directly at [walterheck@helixiora.com](mailto:walterheck@helixiora.com).

## Let’s Make This a Success!
This swag store is a community effort — the more we sell, the more everyone benefits. So don’t wait! Pre-order before December 20th, support the conference, and secure your piece of Config Management Camp history.

Thank you for being part of this journey. We can’t wait to see you in 2025, decked out in some awesome swag!

— Kris, Tosh and all the Organizers of Config Management Camp

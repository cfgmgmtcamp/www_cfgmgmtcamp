We're pleased to announce CfgMgmtCamp 2026, the eighth year and tenth edition.
While CfgMgmtCamp has evolved beyond pure configuration management, we are evolving the topics and content of the conference.
CfgMgmtCamp wants to join all infrastructure management tools and principles to come together to share and learn about infra mgmt.

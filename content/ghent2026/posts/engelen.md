CfgMgmtCamp thrives because of its community — and that includes the volunteers who help keep everything running smoothly during the event. This year, we’re happy to announce that we’re using **Engelsystem** to coordinate volunteer shifts and tasks.

Engelsystem gives us a clear overview of where help is needed and makes it easier for volunteers to sign up for roles that fit their schedule. If you’ve volunteered before, the workflow should feel familiar; if you’re new, it’s straightforward and easy to get started.

### What We’re Looking For

Right now, we’re especially looking for volunteers to **keep an eye on specific rooms**, preferably by covering **larger blocks of time** rather than short, fragmented shifts. This helps reduce handover overhead and makes the experience smoother for both speakers and attendees.

### Room Volunteer Duties

As a room volunteer, your responsibilities are simple but essential:

- **Support the speaker** before and during their talk if needed
- **Hand over the speaker gift** after the talk
- **Coordinate the transition to the next speaker**, making sure they show up and are ready to go

You’re not expected to handle technical issues alone — just to be a friendly, reliable point of contact and help keep the schedule on track.

### You’re Not On Your Own

To make sure volunteers always have backup, we’ll be hosting a **dedicated chat room** during the event. This will be the primary place to **reach out for help, ask questions, or flag issues** if something unexpected comes up. Organizers and fellow volunteers will be there to support you.

### Why Volunteer?

Volunteering is a great way to:

- Give back to the CfgMgmtCamp community
- Get a behind-the-scenes look at how the event runs
- Meet speakers, organizers, and fellow attendees

If you have some time during the camp and want to help make it a great experience for everyone, we’d love to have you.

👉 **Sign up via [https://volunteer.cfgmgmtcamp.org/](https://volunteer.cfgmgmtcamp.org/)   and pick a room or time block that works for you.**  
Every contribution helps — and we really appreciate it.

Thank you for supporting CfgMgmtCamp!

CfgMgmtCamp 2026 in Ghent (2–4 February 2026) now has a full and impressively packed schedule. 
We had a lot  more talks to review than the last couple of years but tried to create a schedule that caters for a variety of interests.
We have talks about  case  studies, new tools, traditional tools, souvereign cloud , open source in general and many more.
Like the last couple of years we have a large number of community rooms focussing specific tools,  Vox, Tofu, Ansible are the more known ones, but we have a CI/CD room , and even a Nix room.


Next to the regular tracks , the  conference also features a  large number ofw workshops, all taking place on the third day, covering a wide range of hands-on or community-focused topics. 
These include but are not limited to topics such as  Hands-on Infrastructure-as-Code with OpenTofu , Flox: The power of nix without the pain, Immutable Kubernetes , Latest and greatest developments in CUE, 
Hands-On Infrastructure Management with System Initiative, Modern Network Observability, and Prowler , alongside full-day community events such as the Vox Pupuli Community Day and the Ansible Contributor Summit.

As always, registration is free but required for crowd control and room sizing.

Looking forward to see you all in Gent in a couple of weeks !

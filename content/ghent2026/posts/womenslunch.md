After the great response we had earlier this year, we will reprise this networking lunch event on the first day of CfgMgmtCamp 2026, and we'd like to invite all attendees who identify as women to join each other for this free lunch event!

* Date: Monday, Feb 2, 2026 
* Time: 13:00 - 14:00 
* Location: Reserved area in the HoGent Cafeteria 
* Cost: Complimentary 

We'll begin with a brief introduction and suggest discussion topics. However, there is no set agenda. You are welcome to mingle with one another and join the discussions while enjoying lunch.

Indicate your participation by registering! During the event [registration](https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2026/registration/) process, please select the option for "Women Lunch Registration" on Monday 2 February 2026.

We look forward to seeing you there!

        <h3>George Miranda - Tuesday, February 3 11:20-12:00 - B.4.039</h3>

        <p>
          "DevOps" means different things to different people. But now many
          vendors are slapping a "DevOps" sticker on the same software they've
          sold for 20 years and calling it new.  How can we say that's not
          DevOps when we can't wrap our heads around the general practices of
          DevOps?
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't all need to deploy 10+ times per day to production, but
          there's still a common set of practices we're embracing as a
          community.  The DevOps talent pool needs to grow faster before more
          half-baked "DevOps Toolkits" try to fill the void we should be filling
          with experienced practitioners.  So how do we get there?
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll look at observations from having helped many orgs in different
          phases of adopting DevOps to ask the question: if Mr Miyagi was
          training the next wave of DevOps Engineers, what chores would he use
          to instill the right bits of muscle memory that turn us into prize
          fighters?

        <h2>About George Miranda</h2>

        <p>
          George Miranda has made a career working as an Infrastructure Monkey
          in Web Ops for over 15 years at a variety of small dotcoms and large,
          before joining CHEF and working with a variety of small dotcoms and
          large enterprises trying to get started with Configuration Management,
          DevOps, and Continuous Delivery.  He joined Chef as a part of the
          Professional Services group, but now spends most of his time working
          with Chef ecosystem partners.  He spends a lot of time pondering how
          we, as a community, can scale DevOps to stay ahead of the market
          demand tsunami that enables things like â€˜streamlined suites of devops
          cloud enablement tools' to exist.  When he reads phrases like that, he
          is sometimes forced to take solace in Belgian beer.

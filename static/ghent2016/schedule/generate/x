:Speaker's Name:Session Title:Abstract:Speaker Bio 
Walter Heck:"Configuration Management, time for a 4GL?":"In programming languages we saw generations of languages; 3GL languages like C++, C#, Java etc. 4GL languages like Delphi and Visual FoxPro aimed to abstract away many of the things not so relevant for GUI Database applications.  In Configuration Management we have roughly seen 3 generations of tools so far cfEngine is of the first generation, Puppet, Chef, Ansible and the likes are second generation, while tools like docker, rocket and the likes can be considered the 3rd generation.  What could we imagine a 4th generation to be like? In this talk we’ll look at the strengths and weaknesses of our current tools and sum up properties we’d like to see in a 4th generation tools.":"Walter Heck is the founder and CTO of OlinData. He is co-organiser of the configuration management devroom at FOSDEM and co-organiser of the config management camp.  Walter has more then a decade of background in Programming, MySQL Databases and more recently Puppet and all the tools that come with it.  Walter has spoken at many international conferences on 3 continents over the past 6 years."

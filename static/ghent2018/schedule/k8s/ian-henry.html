        <h1>Containerize This : A Brief (possibly drunk) and mildy interesting look at the history of containerization and why it matters.</h1>
        <h3>Ian Henry - Tuesday, February 6, 15:40 - 16:20 - B.4.039</h3>
        <p>
          Over the last few years (and specially as the Kubernetes behemoth has
          taken hold) we have learned more and more about how to be successful
          with containerization.  There is a lot of wisdom thats been spread on
          the subject from blog posts to lectures, whitepapers and everything
          in-between  but not many people fully understand the "why". Behind
          the movement.  What's more many operators and developers have never
          stopped to ask themselves what outcome they might have hoped for in an
          attempt to containerize their services outside of - Well it's what folks
          are doing now.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would posit that these failed experiments in the cold void of
          etherspace came from the desire to unify management of their services
          into a single shape.  Managing different types of services with
          different patterns and tools lends itself to the creation of brittle
          systems with razor sharp edges that can easily cut unsuspecting
          operators.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this talk is to dive into each of these issues and to
          expose the value of unified management of containerized services with
          Habitat + Kubernetes.

          As the Technical Community Advocate for Habitat, Ian is actively
          helping the Community and ecosystem grow.  He spends much of his time
          helping people learn about containerization, distributed systems, and
          the ways that Habitat makes those things easy.  Prior to joining Chef,
          Ian spent a number of years as an operator and tools engineer.
